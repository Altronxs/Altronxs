## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Kyle Alexander Baldovi**, a Cybersecurity student at Waipahu High School, born and raised in **Ewa Beach, Hawai‘i**. My journey into tech began not with a love for syntax, but with a fascination for solving problems and designing systems that actually work. I thrive at the intersection of **hardware and software**, where creativity meets logic and every challenge is an opportunity to build something better.
